# EXERCICE DOCKER

# Build a Docker image for the seqClass.py script written during the Git hands-on. Make sure you can run the script within the corresponding Docker container and upload the image to DockerHub.

## I have to create a document called Dockerfile in the git_HandsOn folder with the following code:

	# Set the base image to Python 3.9
		FROM python:3.9

	# Add custom label
		LABEL maintainer "celiatorresvilanova <celiatovi@hotmail.com>" \
      	version "0.1" \
      	description "Docker image for seqClass.py script"

	# Set the working directory in the container to /app
		WORKDIR /app

	# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
		COPY . /app

	# Expose port 5000 for the Flask app
		EXPOSE 5000

	# Set the default command to run when a container is started
		CMD ["python", "app.py"]


sudo docker build -t seqclass .              # Build a docker image using my Dockerfile

sudo docker run seqclass ls		            # Create a container from my image and list the files inside it

sudo docker run --entrypoint python seqclass seqClass.py -s ATCG  # This will run the seqclass.py script within the container. The output is "The sequence is DNA"

sudo docker run --entrypoint python seqclass seqClass.py -s AUCG  # This will run the seqclass.py script within the container. The output is "The sequence is RNA"

sudo docker run --entrypoint python seqclass seqClass.py -s atcg  # This will run the seqclass.py script within the container. The output is "The sequence is DNA"

sudo docker run --entrypoint python seqclass seqClass.py -s aucg  # This will run the seqclass.py script within the container. The output is "The sequence is RNA"

sudo docker login                              # Login to DockerHub 

sudo docker push celiatorresvilanova/seqclass  # Upload the image to DockerHub
